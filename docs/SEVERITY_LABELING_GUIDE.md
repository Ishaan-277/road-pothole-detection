# Pothole Severity Labelling Guide

Last updated: 2026-10-17

This guide defines the visual labels used by the prototype severity classifier. These labels describe visible surface impact; they are not engineering measurements of depth, structural damage, or repair cost.

## Labelling principles

- Judge the highlighted pothole, not the overall condition of the road.
- Use the full source image as context while checking the saved crop.
- Do not infer depth when shadows, water, glare, or camera angle make it unknowable.
- Mark ambiguous examples as `uncertain`; do not force them into a severity class.
- Mark repeated detections of the same pothole in one source image as `duplicate`.
- Exclude detections that are not potholes.

## Severity classes

### Low

- Small visible footprint relative to the lane.
- Limited surface breakup.
- Shallow appearance with little shadow or exposed subsurface material.
- Likely to require monitoring or minor repair.

### Medium

- Clear pothole with a moderate footprint or visible material loss.
- Noticeable edge breakdown, shadow, or exposed underlying layer.
- Large enough to affect a normal vehicle path but not visually extreme.

### High

- Large footprint, pronounced breakup, or strong evidence of depth.
- Jagged edges, substantial material loss, multiple connected cavities, or exposed base.
- Appears likely to pose an immediate hazard or require priority repair.

## Non-severity outcomes

- `uncertain`: visibility or context is inadequate for a defensible label.
- `duplicate`: another row represents the same pothole in the same source image.
- `not_pothole`: detection is a crack, patch, shadow, drain, puddle, or other false positive.

The collection tool records `not_pothole` with keyboard key `6`.

## Review quality process

For the next batch:

1. Label at least 1,000 usable examples with deliberate sampling across data sources.
2. Have a second reviewer independently label at least 20% of the examples.
3. Measure agreement before resolving disagreements.
4. Keep the original reviewer labels as separate columns rather than overwriting them.
5. Resolve disagreements through review and record the adjudicated label.
6. Keep all crops from a source image in one train, validation, or test split.

## Known limitation

Visual severity is only a proxy. Reliable physical severity may require calibrated camera geometry, scale references, depth sensors, or multiple viewpoints.
